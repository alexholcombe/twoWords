# twoWords
You need Psychopy to run the program.
After you start Psychopy, you need to open
twoWords.py which you can find here on this github project page.

Additional files needed for full functioning of the program are:
* stringResponse.py
* noiseStaircaseHelpers.py

After you click Run (the green man at top of Psychopy), a few dialog boxes will pop up. If you accept all the default values in those boxes, the experiment will begin.

Its basic design is 2 (words flipped or no) x 2 (respond first right/left) x 5 (serial position cued).

The dependent variables spit out (when all the trials are completed, or when you hit ESC to abort early) are:

* stream0 %correct
* stream0 %approximately correct
* stream1 %correct
* stream1 %approximately correct
