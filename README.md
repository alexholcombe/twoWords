# twoWords
Psychopy experiment involving report of two simultaneously-presented words

Does RSVP, and flashes one really large circle around both streams.

You provide it with a list of words/strings, and it independently samples from them to create the two streams.

Branched off of my [Attentional Blink code](https://github.com/alexholcombe/attentional-blink)

Issues

* Have approximately correct spit out to data file.
* Add Kim's single-shot code for reading in list of words from a file.

* Add pre-cues.
* Change cue size appropriately. Maybe separate circles in widely-spaced case.
