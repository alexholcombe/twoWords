How quickly are words processed and read? 
The below ad from Honda (click to watch) affords an interesting perspective on this.

Viewing the flurry of words that rush by, you may surprise yourself with your ability to read several of the sentences. But do you feel you were aware of every word? I sometimes have the sense that I didn't experience each word as an individual, they went by too fast, but somehow at the end I nevertheless know what all the words are.

Something similar may happen with normal reading. Good readers can read at about 300 words per minute, and the words in the video go at a similar rate. But in normal reading, you may not get the same sense of not experiencing individual words.

Actually the experience may be similar, but the act of asking yourself about the experience gives different results in the Toyota ad case than in the case of normal reading.

In 'normal' reading - reading words on a page - if you ever ask yourself whether you experienced any particular word, your attention will quickly go back to that word and any more fleeting feeling of the word being gone will immediately be replaced by a full experience of the word.  So we never get to linger on fleeting feelings in normal reading.

I went frame-by-frame through several seconds of the beginning video to calculate that some of the sentences are presented at faster than 6 words per second. That's 360 words per minute, not far off normal reading speed.
