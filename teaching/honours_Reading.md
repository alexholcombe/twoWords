How quickly are words processed and read? 
The below ad from Honda (click to watch) affords an interesting perspective on this.

Viewing the ad, you may be able to read some of the sentences and repeat it back to yourself. But do you feel you were aware of every word? There's certainly some sort of automaticity here that probably contributes to my feeling that I didn't necessarily 'see' every word.

Something similar may happen with normal reading. Good readers can read at about 300 words per minute, and the words in the video go at a similar rate. But in normal reading, you may not get the same sense of not experiencing individual words.

Actually the experience may be similar, but the act of asking yourself about the experience gives different results in the Toyota ad case than in the case of normal reading.

In 'normal' reading - reading words on a page - if you ever ask yourself whether you experienced any particular word, your attention will quickly go back to that word and any more fleeting feeling of the word being gone will immediately be replaced by a full experience of the word.  So we never get to linger on fleeting feelings in normal reading.
